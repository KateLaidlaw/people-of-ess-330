    "text": "Enforcing Relative Paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nWorking with absolute paths can be a pain compared to relative paths…\n\n\n\n\nIt is a good practice to keep all the files associated with a project — input data, R scripts, analytic results, figures - together.\nThis is such a common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via projects.\nA good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:\n\nIt will help ensure the integrity of your data;\nIt makes it simpler to share your code with someone else (a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);\nIt allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;\nIt makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break."

In contrast, hard disks retain data even when the system is powered down."

To publish a user site, you must create a repository named &lt;user&gt;.github.io. Active user sites are available at http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io.\nproject sites are connected to a single project (repository). The source files for a project site are stored in the same repository as their project. Active project sites are available at URLs following the pattern: http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository&gt;.\n\nWhy are Github Pages cool? Well they are free. They are secure.

Throughout this class, we’ll use packages that exist in the aggregate tidyverse package.\n\nTidyverse\nThe tidyverse contains a collection of very useful packages that play nicely together for data exploration, manipulation, wrangling and visualization (among other things). Packages can be installed from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) using the following pattern which should be typed in the console (yellow box):\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nAfter you press ‘Enter,’ you should see a whole bunch of text streaming across the Console Window. This is a good sign and is simply logging what’s being downloaded/installed. This process can go on for a few minutes (the tidyverse has a lot of different components). You will know it’s done when the active cursor shows up again waiting for your next command.\nOnce it’s installed, you can ensure that everything worked by loading/attaching the tidyverse using the library call:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter()     masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::group_rows() masks kableExtra::group_rows()\n✖ dplyr::lag()        masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWhen you press enter, some information will come up below the command. Don’t worry too much about it now as long as there are no errors!\nIf you got something similar to the above you’ve successfully installed R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package. Congratulations!"

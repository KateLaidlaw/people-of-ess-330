    "text": "About this course\nQuantitative reasoning involves analyzing, interpreting, and solving problems using numerical and logical reasoning. This course equips students with essential data science and quantitative skills, focusing on applying these methods to problems in ecosystem science and sustainability.\nStudents will engage in practical data-driven approaches through lectures, live coding demonstrations, discussions, and hands-on lab sessions. The course emphasizes the use of open-source technologies (R, Quarto), statistical methods, geospatial data analysis, and machine learning within reproducible workflows.\nBy the end of this course, students will:\n\nAssess ecosystem science challenges using quantitative tools.\n\nApply data-driven methods to real-world sustainability issues.\n\nUse these skills in scientific research, decision-making, and environmental data analysis.\n\nPrerequisites: MATH 155/160; STAT 301/307/315; ESS 211 or LIFE 320\nCredits: 3\nCourse Website: https://github.com/mikejohnson51/csu-ess-330"

These short assignments (30 minutes) are graded pass/fail and are intended to reinforce the concepts learned during lectures. Students are required to complete 25 out of 29 assignments, with the remaining 4 serving as extra credit opportunities.\n\n\nLab Activities (10%)\nEach weeks lab will have an associated activity, completed in class, that helps solidify topics from lecture. Students are required to complete 12 out of 13 activities, with the remaining 1 serving as extra credit opportunities.\n\n\nLabs (50%)\nApproximately 9 hands-on labs will provide applied learning experiences, focusing on solving real-world problems through data analysis. Lab assignments will be released on Sundays and are due the designated Sunday at 11:59 PM. While some labs only last 1 weeks, others will take more.\n\n\nFinal project (20%)\nStudents will design and choose a final project to demonstrate their quantitative reasoning skills, mixing ideas from lectures and labs to answer a question of interest to them. Final projects will be presented in the final lab section - lightning talk style.\n\n\nExtra Credit Opportunities (10%)"

It seeks to provide a curreated set of the best material along with careful guidance through it. If someone has made exceptional resources, we want to share that with you rather then reinvnet the wheel (a core tenet of data science at large - borrow, share, contirbute)"

    "text": "How to Approach this course:\nThe material covered in the course aims to provide continuity and it is cumulative. You will be learning a set of practical skills meaning that techniques we learn in early weeks will be necessary for understanding things that come later. It also means that regular practice will help you a lot. So, this is not a ‚ÄúTopic of the week‚Äù course where you can tune out for a few weeks while expecting to be able to easily drop back in later. The material we cover each week will not be overwhelming. If you participate during class and keep up with the weekly assignments you‚Äôll be in a very strong position to do well in the class. If you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôll be harder than you expected."

    "text": "My promise\nThis course is designed to build practical, cumulative skills that are essential for success in environmental data science. Each week‚Äôs content builds on what you‚Äôve learned before, so regular participation and consistent practice are key. Labs and daily assignments will reinforce foundational concepts, and early engagement will set you up for long-term success.\nBy committing to the work and completing the daily assignments, you‚Äôll gain valuable skills and perform well. Jaque, Alan, and I will be here to support you throughout the semester, ready to help you navigate any challenges.\nThis course may present a steep learning curve, but with persistence and effort, you‚Äôll find the support you need to succeed. Stick with the course, stay engaged, and do the work‚Äîespecially the daily assignments‚Äîand you‚Äôll not only earn a good grade, but also build the skills to excel as an environmental data scientist.\nThis approach has proven effective for many past students, including those I‚Äôve hired at Lynker and NOAA. While some students may choose to withdraw, I‚Äôve never had a student who stuck with the course and put in the effort finish with a grade lower than a B.\nSo, please don‚Äôt let the possibility of a challenging start be a reason to hold back!"

If you haven‚Äôt used these tools before, don‚Äôt worry - we will get up and running with them during the first week."
